    "\n",
    "Search engine is a software program and web browser tool which is used\n",
    "to access or navigate enormous amounts of data over the internet. It is\n",
    "not a web browser, although it can be accessed by web browser. When we\n",
    "type our query, the search engine analyzes our query and indexes its\n",
    "copious web pages on the internet and provides the relevant answers for\n",
    "our query. Examples of search engines are Google search engine, Yahoo\n",
    "search engine, Bing search engine, Duckduckgo search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we need to use search engine:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons to use search engines, to find information quickly. A lot more\n",
    "information is available on the internet to find out the specific\n",
    "information search engine plays a crucial role to provide a relevant\n",
    "answer to our query. It will save our time and effort because we need to\n",
    "access thousands of webpages manually, to avoid this we need to use\n",
    "search engine. Learning efficiency would be affected if we do not use\n",
    "the search engine because we need to refer books, newspapers and lots of\n",
    "webpages to get the relevant information to our query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the search engine works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **1.Crawling:** Crawling is a program which is also called\n",
    "> **‘Spider’** or **‘Bot’.** It provides the current information related\n",
    "> to our query by revisiting the webpages regularly and for any changes\n",
    "> or updates available. Crawling allows us to create an index of\n",
    "> webpages that can be searched for and returned to users. The purpose\n",
    "> of creating an index is to make it easier and faster for search\n",
    "> engines to provide relevant search results to users. When a user\n",
    "> enters a search query, the search engine looks up the query in its\n",
    "> index and returns a list of web pages that are relevant to the query.\n",
    "> The more webpages the search engine crawls and indexes the more\n",
    "> comprehensive result it will provide.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2.**Indexing:** after the crawling\n",
    "\n",
    "process next is indexing Imagine you have a library with thousands of\n",
    "books. It would be difficult and time-consuming to find a specific book\n",
    "without a catalog that lists the title, author, and location of each\n",
    "book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, search engines create an index, which is like a catalog of\n",
    "web pages on the internet. The index has information about each page,\n",
    "such as the page's title, content, and keywords, which makes it easier\n",
    "and faster to find relevant pages when a user enters a search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you search for something on a search engine, the search engine\n",
    "looks up the query in its index to find the most relevant web pages. The\n",
    "index is constantly updated as the search engine crawls the web,\n",
    "discovering new pages and removing outdated or irrelevant pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, indexing is an essential part of the search engine process that\n",
    "allows search engines to quickly and accurately provide relevant search\n",
    "results to users by organizing and storing the vast amount of\n",
    "information available on the internet..\n",
    "\n",
    "3.**Ranking:** When a user enters a search query, the search engine\n",
    "retrieves relevant pages from its index and ranks them in order of\n",
    "relevance. The ranking algorithm takes into account the quality of the\n",
    "website, and the popularity of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.**Retrieval:** The search engine presents the user with a list of\n",
    "search results, usually in order of relevance, along with a snippet of\n",
    "text from each page to give the user an idea of what the page is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. **Refinement**: Users can refine their search by using filters or\n",
    "advanced search operators to narrow down the results and find what\n",
    "they're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "By all search engine works by crawling the internet, analyzing the\n",
    "contents of web pages and ranking them based on relevance to search\n",
    "queries. This process is constantly being refined and updated to provide\n",
    "the better answers for user"
