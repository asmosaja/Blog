    "A website is a collection of web pages that are accessible via the\n",
    "internet. You can access the web pages (Webpage is a single document or\n",
    "file) using URL or domain name of a particular website. Collection of\n",
    "web pages make up a website.\n",

    "**URL to access the webpages:**\n",

    "If you enter the URL of the particular website, client (you) is\n",

    "specific webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Name to access the webpages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you enter the domain name in your web browser, your browser sends a\n",
    "request to Domain Name System server to resolve the domain name to the\n",
    "IP address. It does not send the request directly to webserver. Once the\n",
    "DNS server responds with the IP address associated with the domain name,\n",
    "your web browser then sends a request directly to the website server\n",
    "using the IP address to access the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need to use websites?**\n",
    "\n",
    "websites are accessible on any device with an internet connection and do\n",
    "not require installation or updates. They can also be easily shared and\n",
    "accessed by anyone with a web browser, making them a more inclusive and\n",
    "democratic option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the website work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Client sends a request to the webserver by entering the URL\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The website's server receives the request and searches for the\n",
    "    requested web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If the requested web page is found, the server sends the web page\n",
    "    content back to the browser in the form of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n",
    "    files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The browser then renders the HTML, applies the CSS styling, and\n",
    "    executes any JavaScript code, which creates the final website layout\n",
    "    and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  The website's server may also interact with databases, files, and\n",
    "    other resources to generate dynamic content and respond to user\n",
    "    input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, a website is a combination of web technologies, including HTML,\n",
    "CSS, JavaScript, and server-side programming (python, PHP, Ruby) that\n",
    "work together to deliver content to the user's web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do most of the websites use cookies?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookies are used on websites to store information on a user's computer\n",
    "or device. They are small text files created by a website and stored on\n",
    "the user's browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookies are typically used for the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session Management:** This allows the website to remember who the user\n",
    "is and what they have done on the website, for example on the ecommerce\n",
    "website what item people had added to the cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personalization:** Cookies can be used to personalize the user\n",

    "**How does the website know your IP Address?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you enter a website's domain name or URL into your web browser,\n",
    "your browser sends a request to the website's server asking for the\n",
    "webpage to be displayed. This request includes your IP address, which\n",
    "the server uses to send the webpage back to your device.\n",
    "\n",
