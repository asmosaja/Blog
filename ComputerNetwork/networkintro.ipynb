    "Computer network is a group of computers, servers, and other devices\n",
    "connected to each other (why do they have to connect?) to share\n",
    "resources and communicate with each other. The resources might be\n",
    "printers, internet connections, files and so on. How can a computer\n",
    "communicate? Through a communication protocol (protocol is just a set of\n",
    "rules to follow, to communicate with other devices). When computers are\n",
    "connected, they can share things like pictures, videos, and messages\n",
    "with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a quite effortless way, Assume you and your friend work in different\n",
    "companies as a software engineer. If you would like to communicate with\n",
    "him, you can use phone call, video call or messaging app (these are the\n",

    "**Why this computer network is important for us:**\n",

    "**What happens if we** **don’t use the Computer Network technology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don’t use the Computer Network concepts, we just rely on the\n",
    "traditional methods for communication like sending messages through the\n",
    "letters and rely on physical storage devices such as hard drives or USBs\n",
    "to transfer the data between computers and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of networks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.**Local Area Network (LAN):** - devices would be connected in a small\n",
    "area most commonly using wired connections such as EHTERNET cables used\n",
    "to form the LAN network.\n",
    "\n",
    "A LAN can be connected to a [wide area\n",
    "network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network) (WAN) using a\n",
    "[router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **Wide Area Network (WAN):** - devices would be connected in a large\n",
    "area using both wire and wireless connections. Wireless connections for\n",
    "WANs typically use technologies such as microwave, satellite, or\n",
    "cellular networks. Wired connections for WANs such as Fiber optic\n",
    "cables, copper wires, coaxial cables, and leased lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):** - A MAN is a network that\n",
    "connects devices within a metropolitan area, such as a city.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**: A WLAN is a LAN that uses\n",
    "wireless technology, such as Wi-Fi, to connect devices together without\n",
    "using cables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. **Storage Area Network (SAN)**: A SAN is a specialized network that\n",
    "is used to connect storage devices, such as disk arrays or tape\n",
    "libraries, to servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.**Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: A VPN is a network that uses the\n",
    "public internet to create a secure, encrypted connection between remote\n",
    "users and a private network.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.**Peer-to-Peer Network (P2P):** A P2P network is a decentralized\n",
    "network where all devices can act as both a client and a server,\n",
    "allowing for direct communication and file sharing between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethernet** is the most reliable and fastest network for data transfer\n",
    "over short distances, while **cellular** networks are the best choice\n",
    "for long-distance data transfer. **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth** are both\n",
    "convenient for mobile devices and can be useful for transferring lesser\n",
    "amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is best for data transmission?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethernet networks are generally considered the best choice for data\n",
    "transfer within a local area network (LAN), such as within a home or\n",
    "office building. Ethernet is a wired network that provides reliable and\n",
    "fast data transfer, with speeds ranging from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps\n",
    "depending on the equipment used. Ethernet is also more secure than\n",
    "wireless networks, as it **requires physical access to the network cable\n",
    "to intercept data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cellular networks, on the other hand, use **radio waves to** **transmit\n",
    "data** over a wireless network and can provide data transfer speeds\n",
    "ranging from 3G to 5G depending on the network and device. Cellular\n",
    "networks are convenient because they allow users to connect from\n",
    "anywhere, but they can be less reliable and slower than Ethernet\n",
    "networks, especially in areas with poor signal strength or network\n",
    "congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wired connections** generally offer higher speeds, greater\n",
    "reliability, and lower latency, while **wireless connections** offer\n",
    "greater mobility and flexibility. However, wireless connections can be\n",
    "affected by factors such as distance, signal interference, and network\n",
    "congestion."
