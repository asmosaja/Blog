    "\n",
    "Virtual memory is used because it allows a computer to run more programs\n",
    "than the amount of physical memory (RAM) available in the system. By\n",
    "using virtual memory, a computer can temporarily store data on the hard\n",
    "drive when it runs out of physical memory, freeing up space in RAM for\n",
    "other tasks. This allows the computer to run more programs than it would\n",
    "otherwise be able to and prevents crashes caused by running out of\n",
    "memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual memory also allows for the efficient sharing of memory resources\n",
    "between different programs running on the computer. This means that\n",
    "multiple programs can use the same physical memory without interfering\n",
    "with each other, which enhances the system’s overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens if we do not use Virtual Memory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If your computer does not have virtual memory, it would run out of\n",
    "physical memory (RAM) as soon as the number of programs running exceeded\n",
    "the amount of available memory. This would cause the computer to become\n",
    "extremely slow or even crash and severely limit the number of programs\n",
    "which run simultaneously. If a large amount of memory needs to run\n",
    "properly, and without virtual memory we cannot be able to run multiple\n",
    "programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does virtual memory work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a program is run, it is divided into smaller parts called\n",
    "**pages**. These pages are loaded into physical memory (RAM) as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when the physical memory is running low, the operating system\n",
    "will move some pages out of physical memory and store them on the hard\n",
    "drive. This process is called **“paging out” or “swapping out”** and it\n",
    "frees up space in physical memory for other programs to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the program needs to access a page that has been paged out, the\n",
    "operating system will “**page in” or “swap in**” the necessary page from\n",
    "the hard drive back into physical memory."
