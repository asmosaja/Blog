    "**Memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is to store the raw data or information in the computer. In\n",
    "computers there would be temporary memory storage and permanent memory\n",
    "storage just like how humans store their information in the short term\n",
    "and long-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is of three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Primary memory\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Secondary memory\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Cache memory\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Primary memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call primary memory as main memory or semiconductor memory.\n",
    "Primary memory uses semiconductor technology \\[ note: semiconductor is a\n",
    "material that conducts electricity more than the insulator but less than\n",
    "the conductor. semiconductors can be found in thousands of products such\n",
    "as computers, smartphones, memory, microprocessors, etc.\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary memory is **volatile or non-volatile** in nature \\[note :\n",
    "volatile means as soon as the computer is switched off, the information\n",
    "stored in the main memory would be erased.\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Volatile memory is a temporary data storage that requires power to\n",
    "keep the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-volatile memory is a permanent data storage that does not require\n",
    "power to keep the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of primary memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Based on **Volatile**:\n",

    "I. RAM\n",

    "> Based on **Non-volatile**:\n",
    "\n",
    "III\\. ROM\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **RAM (Random Access Memory)** is a volatile memory. The data or\n",
    "    instructions in the RAM is directly accessible by the microprocessor\n",
    "    at a faster speed. RAM is used for booting, running applications,\n",
    "    loading files, performing calculations and so on. **Without RAM a\n",
    "    computer cannot run.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> They are two types of RAM:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1.SRAM\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2.DRAM\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **1.SRAM (static RAM)** used for faster, energy efficient and small.\n",
    "> Static RAM uses Transitions and circuits. SRAM is faster and more\n",
    "> expensive than DRAM and is used in applications where speed and\n",
    "> efficiency are critical and provides less access time. It uses Flip\n",
    "> Flop to store information.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **2.DRAM (Dynamic RAM)** uses Capacitors and Transistors to store\n",
    "> data, Less cost. The name refers that it should be refreshed\n",
    "> periodically. laptops, mobile devices use DRAM\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Cache memory:** It is high-speed memory used by the CPU to store\n",
    "often used data and instructions to improve system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**III. ROM (Read Only Memory)** is a non-volatile memory. It is used for\n",
    "long-term storage of data that needs to be retained even when power is\n",
    "turned off or lost. It can be used to store system firmware, BIOS, or\n",
    "other critical data that needs to be retained even when the power is\n",
    "turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Four types of ROM:\n",

    "> 4.EEPROM\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 5.Flash Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **MROM (Mask ROM):** It stores the information permanently with a\n",
    "    set of instructions or data during the manufacturing process. Once\n",
    "    the programming is done it cannot be changed or updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **PROM (Programmable ROM):** It allows the user to program the\n",
    "    memory after it is manufactured.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **EPROM (Erasable PROM):** It is programmed and erased multiple\n",
    "    times using ultraviolet light.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **EEPROM (Electrically EPROM):** The data needs to be retrieved even\n",
    "    when power is removed or where the frequency updates are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Flash memory:** Flash memory is special because it can be\n",
    "    programmed and erased multiple times. It works by using tiny\n",
    "    electrical charges to store data in small memory cells. These memory\n",
    "    cells are organized into blocks, which can be erased and\n",
    "    reprogrammed when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **Secondary memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call it auxiliary memory or backup memory. It is non-volatile\n",
    "memory used to store large data permanently. It is slower than Primary\n",
    "memory. CPU cannot access directly from secondary memory. Without\n",
    "secondary memory computers can run.\n",

    "types of secondary memory:\n",

    "1\\. Magnetic Tapes.\n",

    "2.Magnetic disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Optical disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Magnetic Tapes:** Sequential access storage media means data\n",
    "    stored and retrieved in linear order. This helps them to be useful\n",
    "    for storing enormous amounts of data. It is used for backup and\n",
    "    archival purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Magnetic disks:** Random access storage. It is used as a primary\n",
    "    storage device and provides fast access. It can be either HDDs or\n",
    "    SSDs. HDDs use spinning disks coated with magnetic material to store\n",
    "    the data (stores on sectors and tracks) while SSDs use NAND flash\n",
    "    memory chip to store the data. SSDs do not have moving parts which\n",
    "    makes them faster and more reliable than HDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Optical disks:** laser-based storage medium: CDs and DVDs."
